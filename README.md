# snRNAseq analysis 

This repository contains all analysis and statistical scripts used on the OAC snRNAseq dataset. Scripts to run the Nextflow pipeline are in [src/snRNAseq_workflow/](src/snRNAseq_workflow/). Instructions for recreating the Singularity containers used for this analysis are in [singularity/README.md](singularity/README.md). 

The accompanying Nextflow pipeline can be found in the [snRNAseq_workflow](https://github.com/alextidd/snRNAseq_workflow) repository.
